        <h3 id="my-ccna-experience">My CCNA experience</h3>
<p>I wrote about being &ldquo;halfway done&rdquo; with the course material like over a year ago, which was true. However. The start of the CCNA is fun. You learn how computer networks work! All the terms you&rsquo;ve absorbed throughout the years start making sense. It&rsquo;s addicting.</p>
<p>You have to cram the end of the CCNA. Now that you&rsquo;ve learned routing protocols, you need to memorize their administrative distances. The Cisco iOS syntax quirks. Outdated protocol trivia. Cisco protocols that have been obsoleted by industry adoption of open alternatives: PAgP, HSRP, GLBP, ISL, DTP/VTP, EIGRP, PVST, Rapid PVST+. Oh, the Cisco exams barely cover BGP, the for-all-intents only path-vector minimal-trust routing protocol used to <em>route the internet</em>. Instead, you get the DSCP codepoint values, FHRP MAC OUIs, WiFi bandwidths, the bandwidth of an E3 vs T3 line! Don&rsquo;t forget Cisco-specific GUI operation.</p>
<p>None of these things are interesting to me, with the exception of maybe some of the WiFi trivia and some of EIGRP. I completely burnt out shortly after that blog post, I think I gave up on the CCNA entirely for about 6 months, maybe keeping up on some of the flashcard spaced repetition.</p>
<p>I kept watching the tech industry, particularly software, collapse around me as interest rates renormalized. So the utility of the CCNA rose, and I begrudgingly pushed forward again.</p>
<h3 id="tools-i-used">Tools I used</h3>
<p>JeremysITLab on youtube. This course was amazing. The extra time spent explaining protocols in the videos gets saved when attempting to memorize their functions, I can&rsquo;t recommend this enough. It flagged a bit toward the end, the quality dropped a fair amount when I got to the wireless sections; supplement those videos.</p>
<p>Jeremy provides flash cards for use with Anki, and they are very comprehensive. Delete the worst of the memorization cards, honestly, they&rsquo;re not necessary.</p>
<p>Lastly, Boson ExSim. I bought this subscription and the exam simulation was scarily accurate. Liked this a lot, especially for the labs, which I hadn&rsquo;t really been exposed to before. Sidenote: on the actual CCNA, remember <code>write mem</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-actual-exam">The actual exam</h3>
<p>Was kindof rushed. Toward the beginning of May I learned of a free-exam-retake promotion if I took the CCNA before June 12th. So I scheduled for the 10th. I got sick mid-May, dropped the studying a lot, picked it back up. I thought I recovered, got worse about 4 days before the exam. So I showed up to the exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeply sleep deprived</li>
<li>Nauseous</li>
<li>Hungry, because I still wasn&rsquo;t tolerating solid food</li>
<li>On ritalin</li>
<li>Sweating profusely</li>
</ul>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t taken a proper final exam since college and was honestly shocked at my nerves. I really just wanted the CCNA to be done with, and toward the end of the test, as my ritalin was wearing off and my body was crashing, I had to kick myself to use all my time.</p>
<p>Boson ExSim did a phenomenal job prepping me for the exam environment. It was almost identical to the real thing, minus the legal disclaimers at the start and the note-taking sheet. Can we talk about the note-taking sheet?</p>
<p>They gave me this 10-page dry-erasable notepad to write on at the start of the exam. Then, before the exam starts, you&rsquo;re left alone with it, while you&rsquo;re given like 15 minutes to go through the disclaimer. You could absolutely use this legal disclaimer time to dump a bunch of content onto the notepad if you pre-studied it before entering the exam room. I didn&rsquo;t know about this ahead of time, but I probably would&rsquo;ve written down:</p>
<ul>
<li>routing administrative distances</li>
<li>which protocols are higher or lower (e.g. priority in OSPF is determined by highest values, whereas in spanning-tree it&rsquo;s lowest values)</li>
<li>some of the protocol codes, e.g. <code>802.11s</code> for multiple spanning-tree</li>
<li>whatever rote-memorization I complained about above</li>
</ul>
<p>I was comfortable in all of the labs; the Boson labs were much more convoluted, and also all-or-nothing! Exam labs have clearly stated objectives, with clear opportunity for partial credit. My second exam lab I just was missing something in the routing structure and skipped it for time and felt fine about it.</p>
<p>I read on the CCNA subreddit that you don&rsquo;t know whether or not you pass immediately. I was greeted with an immediate &ldquo;Congratulations, you passed the Exam.&rdquo; screen. I suspect that if you score above a certain threshold on the multiple-choice you get that screen, otherwise your labs need to be evaluated?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to discuss the actual questions and topics, so we&rsquo;re not doing that, sorry. Big fan of having this cert, don&rsquo;t want to lose it!</p>
