        <p>Did a bunch of projects without posting about them. Gonna batch-release these</p>
<h4 id="what-is-nixos">What is nixos</h4>
<p>NixOS is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the concept of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://jonathanlorimer.dev/posts/nix-thesis.html">nix itself</a></li>
<li>your <a href="https://github.com/graevy/nixos">configuration.nix file(s)</a></li>
<li><code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nixos-collect-garbage -d</code></li>
<li>the occasional <code>flake.nix</code> and <code>nix-develop</code></li>
<li>whatever you settle on for misc tooling. for me, <code>nix-shell -p &lt;some package i want to test&gt;</code>, and the <code>nix-search</code> and <code>nix-inspect</code> packages</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Don&rsquo;t believe anyone else. I would never lie to you.</p>
<h4 id="why">Why</h4>
<p>To further the declarative obsession. Because I&rsquo;ve been using the same distro for more than 2 years. To become less sufferable.</p>
<h4 id="what-happened">What happened</h4>
<p>The classic dual-boot<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>-and-replace-old-OS strategy, so there weren&rsquo;t any huge headaches. It took me like a month of hour-a-day reading/tweaking<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to reach feature parity with my arch installation, so you&rsquo;re in for that if you try it.</p>
<p>There were a few blockers:</p>
<ul>
<li>I moved from X to wayland in the middle of this, so lots of trying out new tooling (i.e. i3-&gt;sway)</li>
<li>Versioning gets messy. nix-channel can track state accidentally, some packages need you to bring in unstable nixos, etc.</li>
<li>An edge case. I had to remove some packages, which means editing <code>configuration.nix</code> and then <code>sudo nix-collect-garbage -d &amp;&amp; sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Some of them contained symlink loops to their parent dirs, so nix refused to delete them from <code>/nix/store</code>, and they wormed their way into new derivations! <code>nix-store</code> provided some poorly-documented manual solution (recurring theme for NixOS) so I just reinstalled. That may seem extreme, but NixOS simplifies reinstallation, and I wanted to test the process<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Boot into a new NixOS installation, move your <code>configuration.nix</code> on it, and <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code>. Anything now missing needs to get declared.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="my-takes">My takes</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s good. Unified configuration in a single dir. I&rsquo;m bought-in now, costs completely sunk, which is its own problem.</p>
<p>Flakes. Bad ux. I don&rsquo;t currently see a use for them beyond &ldquo;nix-shell but version-pinned&rdquo;, which is what I want out of a <code>shell.nix</code> file anyway, I think<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>? And for that purpose, it&rsquo;s a huge amount of boilerplate in a really annoying domain-specific language. I&rsquo;m sure people who use them more fluently have better uses for them, and I might get there eventually. For my gripes, I do still use flakes.</p>
<p>NixOS integrates very well with systemd, which I wasn&rsquo;t expecting. I&rsquo;m not really writing my own unit files often, but you can&rsquo;t rely on the abstraction. There&rsquo;s a larger pattern of NixOS&rsquo; native configs not being granular enough. For instance: defining a service that doesn&rsquo;t start automatically on boot requires <a href="https://github.com/graevy/nixos/blob/64d256aa0fe7b5005a7206c2fed2933c1f647754/configuration.nix#L271C1-L275C43">a slight hack</a> where I would really just like <code>services.thing.enabled = true</code> and <code>services.thing.auto = false</code>, and to not have to manually write unitfiles. Truthfully in the spirit of open source I should add the feature to <code>services</code> myself, but I&rsquo;ve heard many horror stories from my hackspace friends about trying to get NixOS PRs merged.</p>
<p>A lot of people complain about massive <code>/nix/store</code>s, and I don&rsquo;t get it. Yes, it frequently stores unnecessary versions that simpler package managers don&rsquo;t have to. This stops things from breaking. My <code>/nix/store</code> is about 58Gb<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, containing 18.2Gb of package versions which <em>might</em> be deduplicated using <code>apt</code> instead<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, but I can&rsquo;t help but think: every deduplication case trusts in backward compatibility. I find NixOS absolutely worth it even on smaller ssds. Maybe the worst-case of <code>/nix/store</code> is a disk hog, but I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet.</p>
<p>When you leave the happy path, it&rsquo;s awful. The documentation is sparse<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, you have to hack to get anything done, in a system that does not want you to create undeclared state. The NixOS equivalent of a &ldquo;linux evening&rdquo; fixing something gets inverted: spend 3 hours building something that won&rsquo;t break, where normal users simply <code>apt install</code>. I honestly think most nixpkgs maintainers are just people who went down a hole and had to build a package about it.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m discussing the happy path &ndash; where do I start with hardcoded file paths? The whole environment begs for a new layer, some interface between path and file that symlinks and <code>nix-ld</code> grasp at<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. But nix, existing mostly in userspace, on top of filesystems and the kernel, can&rsquo;t neatly integrate itself.</p>
<p>What does NixOS offer? ultimately, lightweight portability:</p>
<ul>
<li>easy environmental CI/CD by regenerating old versions of the OS. A great alternative to heavy system backup/restore, but not great for stateful objects, which aren&rsquo;t usually things that break during upgrades, so, great feature!</li>
<li>nix shells/flakes are great solutions to the problem of development/build determinism that are, again, solved more heavily (albeit more completely) by containerization.</li>
<li>configuration centralization. OS-on-a-stick. My system becomes a file, next to my packages, programs, services, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the users complain about a hardcode breaking things</li>
<li>nixpkgs maintainers for e.g. <code>glibc</code> add an entry to the map: <code>/usr/lib/&lt;glibc header&gt;</code> -&gt; <code>/nix/store/&lt;hash&gt;-glibc</code></li>
<li>shim this map at a lower layer, like inside <code>open</code>/<code>openat</code>/<code>stat</code> or even in the kernel?</li>
</ul>
<p>I do see some problems here; trusting the maintainer, debugging gets weird, performance concerns&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know, is this so insane? I&rsquo;m not maintaining packages, or even particularly nix-brained, but even I can see this hole. We could stop haranguing developers (who are often just trying to not break userspace) assuming Filesystem Hierarchy Standard conventions and solve the problem endemically.</p>

<p>or quad-boot, you know, nobody&rsquo;s judging anybody here&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>I did read about a third of Dolstra&rsquo;s thesis. I would legitimately recommend reading about the evaluator&rsquo;s kernel-inspired-memory-management-but-for-disks. For me, that section cleanly described nix&rsquo;s solution to a problem I hadn&rsquo;t deeply considered before.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I also had to left-expand my OS partition after killing some others, so, that was the best time to do it.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>You can version pin via specific commit hashes. I tried it once, don&rsquo;t bother, just use flakes.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I did not garbage-collect before checking, but I did somewhat recently move to 25.05 and then gc.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:7">
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, my arch install had 5 active versions of electron required by various different packages, and my <code>/nix/store</code> contains 4 at the moment. While <code>/nix/store</code> contains version bloat, NixOS neatly collates your packages; you rarely end up with more than you need, whereas conventional package managers tend to bloat over time, even when pruning orphans.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:8">
<p>The NixOS wiki is often just a trap. Like, it&rsquo;s not maintained well, and frequently out of date, also apparently unassociated with the NixOS project? There are two of them, <code>nixos.wiki</code> and <code>wiki.nixos.org</code>, and the unofficial one, <code>nixos.wiki</code>, is the older one that everyone uses. My guess is that they kept getting criticized for having poor documentation and decided to build a competitor to the arch wiki, but they&rsquo;ve moved too late, and now it&rsquo;ll take a decade to sort itself out.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:9">
<p>Symlinks need to exist at the path destination, and <code>nix-ld</code> only handles dynamic linking. What if packages could supply their typical hardcodes without mutating the filesystem?&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
