<h3 id="whats-rootingshould-i-stay-rooted">What&rsquo;s rooting/Should I stay rooted?</h3>
<p>Phone manufacturers don&rsquo;t easily give you full (root) access to your phone. You can break things easily, it&rsquo;s a security nightmare<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and you can remove their data collection/bloatware. If you ask nicely, or sometimes force your way in, you can edit your operating system via your device firmware<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After patching together our edited OS, we must decide whether to expose root access to our apps/our self.</p>
<p>Reasons to stay rooted:</p>
<ul>
<li>root-only package managers and apps
<ul>
<li><a href="https://xdaforums.com/f/xposed-framework-modules.2919/">xposed modules</a></li>
<li>actually usable android file managers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>unlocking vestigial hardware features on some old phones
<ul>
<li>FM/AM radio</li>
<li>Fun With IR<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>very hackable</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasons to not stay rooted:</p>
<ul>
<li>the perpetual cat-and-mouse game of root detection and Magisk<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></li>
<li>larger attack surface<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choosing-a-rom">Choosing a rom</h3>
<p>Some secure roms aren&rsquo;t intended to be rooted. For reasons<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, these are almost exclusively made for Pixel phones. If you have a Pixel, you can choose between <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/">GrapheneOS</a> (my choice), <a href="https://copperhead.co/android/docs/">Copperhead</a>, or <a href="https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/device-support/">CalyxOS</a> (has some motorola/fairphone support!).</p>
<p>Otherwise, you want <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">Lineage</a><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, maybe <a href="https://crdroid.net/downloads">crDroid</a> or something else <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions">listed here</a> that is both open source and still developed. Another option might be decent; I haven&rsquo;t reviewed them in awhile, but LineageOS has a very big community, which you will have to rely on if you encounter The Ugly<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="bootloader-unlocking3">Bootloader Unlocking<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></h3>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t buy a phone specifically for this, this might become much more annoying/&ldquo;impossible&rdquo; based on these results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to settings -&gt; About phone</li>
<li>Tap the build number button like 8 times (I&rsquo;m not trolling you) to unlock developer options</li>
<li>Go to developer options (under <code>system</code> settings) and see if there&rsquo;s an <code>OEM unlocking</code> toggle.</li>
<li>While you&rsquo;re here, enable USB debugging</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>OEM Unlocking</code> is greyed-out, you might have to get an unlock code from your phone manufacturer and insert it via <code>fastboot</code> (this is as annoying as it sounds). Otherwise, you probably can&rsquo;t proceed. Go to <a href="https://xda-developers.com">xda-developers</a>, find your phone subforum, and see if anyone has posted about rooting it. In ye olden days (a decade ago<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, when I first started rooting my phones), you typically had to use some privilege-escalation linux kernel vulnerability to unlock a bootloader. Good luck!</p>
<h3 id="connecting-a-pc-to-a-phone">Connecting a pc to a phone</h3>
<p>Get <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools">android debug bridge</a> (or via package manager) and a computer-&gt;phone usb cable. If you haven&rsquo;t already, enable USB debugging in <code>developer options</code>, and accept whatever pairing prompt comes up when you plug it in<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Verify your connectivity by running <code>adb devices</code> in your terminal.</p>
<h3 id="getting-your-exact-model">Getting your exact model</h3>
<p>Phones with the same name can have different model numbers. You should exactly determine your phone&rsquo;s model number. <code>settings</code> -&gt; <code>about phone</code>, look for <code>model number</code> or <code>regulatory labels</code> or similar. My Pixel 5 has model <code>GD1YQ</code>.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="accessing-your-phones-bootloader-interface">Accessing your phone&rsquo;s bootloader interface</h3>
<p>You can either do this from your pc or from your phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PC: Run <code>adb -d reboot bootloader</code> in your terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phone: Turn your phone off. Turn it on holding both the power and volume down buttons. On some old phones, this will be reversed. Some phones won&rsquo;t register the state of the volume down button if it&rsquo;s held during this entire process, and will require you to repress it once the screen turns on. You&rsquo;ll generally be greeted by a black screen with some jank text on it, maybe a logo if you&rsquo;re lucky, with a rudimentary menu navigable by the 3 buttons. You might have to navigate this menu until you encounter a state labeled <code>bootloader</code> or <code>fastboot</code>. If this screen says <code>recovery</code> and you can&rsquo;t navigate out of it, you&rsquo;re actually in the wrong boot mode! There might be no text at all<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Verify that you&rsquo;re connected to the phone&rsquo;s bootloader interface on your pc by opening a terminal and running <code>fastboot devices</code>.</p>
<h3 id="flashing8">Flashing<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll lose all data on your phone if we proceed. This is the scary step, too. Are you emotionally prepared for that?</p>
<p>Every rom has a different MO for flashing, and you need to find your rom&rsquo;s installation guide (<a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">Lineage</a> <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/web">Graphene</a> <a href="https://copperhead.co/android/docs/install/">Copperhead</a> <a href="https://calyxos.org/install/">Calyx</a>). Most use a script, some might use first-party tools like samsung Odin, many just flash the recovery partition and then package the other partitions like an android update. A non-exhaustive<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> list of partitions you might have to flash:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most will flash <code>boot</code>, the partition your phone is booted into right now. <em><strong><code>A bad bootloader flash is how you brick a phone</code></strong></em>; the bootloader can rescue all other partitions (via <code>fastboot flash</code>). There are tools, usually first-party, to recover from brick, but don&rsquo;t count on them.</li>
<li><code>system</code> stores most of what constitutes our rom. A bad flash here will probably boot-loop your phone.</li>
<li><code>recovery</code> is the partition that helps you rebuild your phone when it breaks; most roms will flash it. I like <a href="https://twrp.me/Devices/">TWRP</a>, though it&rsquo;s not secure (avoid it on the Pixel roms), and you should check version compatibility with your rom.</li>
<li><code>kernel</code>: user-friendly roms aren&rsquo;t usually going to require a custom linux kernel. A bad flash would probably boot-loop or crash frequently.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can backup a partition<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> using <code>dd</code>, e.g. <code>adb shell su -c dd if=/dev/path/to/&lt;partition&gt; &gt; &lt;partition&gt;.img</code> to your pc.</p>
<p>Pretty much every rom installation goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>OEM unlocking and USB debugging need to be enabled</li>
<li><code>fastboot flashing unlock</code> is another safeguard, and <em><strong><code>also the data partition wipe</code></strong></em>.</li>
<li><code>fastboot flash &lt;partition&gt; &lt;uncompressed file&gt;</code> flashes a specific partition. Most ROMs will bundle this in a script of some kind, for aforementioned &ldquo;don&rsquo;t brick your phone&rdquo; reasons. After flashing a few partitions in your guide, you&rsquo;ll be done.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why all the disclaimers? It&rsquo;s very easy to get the wrong firmware (things-to-flash) for your phone. There are 15 different model numbers for my LG V20, only some of which overlap all firmware. Blindly flashing <code>LG V20 H918</code> firmware instead of <code>LG V20 H915</code> could brick, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell without checking.</p>
<h3 id="re-lock-your-bootloader">Re-lock your bootloader?</h3>
<p>Once you re-lock your bootloader in fastboot, unlocking it again will wipe your phone. In the interrim, you can decide whether or not to expose root to yourself and your apps by installing Magisk.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re using one of the secure Pixel roms, you don&rsquo;t want to keep root, and usually they won&rsquo;t let you anyway.</p>
<h3 id="magisk">Magisk</h3>
<p>You can get Magisk <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases">here</a>. It&rsquo;s a neat little platform to manage which apps on your phone get root, or more importantly, which apps can see that <em>you</em> have root. It has its own <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html">guide</a>. If you don&rsquo;t have boot ramdisk, keeping root becomes very tedious and I personally wouldn&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to flash <a href="https://twrp.me/Devices/">TWRP</a> as a recovery, do it now, and try to sideload<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> the Magisk <code>.apk</code> after renaming it to a <code>.zip</code>, to skip this next part.</p>
<p>The Magisk guide doesn&rsquo;t tell you how to get a <code>boot.img</code> copy. Getting <code>init_boot.img</code> works much the same way, just ignore the suffix syntax.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out if you have <code>init_boot.img</code> by running <code>adb shell su -c find /dev -type f -name 'init_boot*' 2&gt;/dev/null</code>.</li>
<li>If nothing, check for a regular <code>boot.img</code> with <code>adb shell su -c find /dev -type f -name 'boot*' 2&gt;/dev/null</code>.</li>
<li>If either of these commands give you multiple <code>_a</code> and <code>_b</code> images, determine the current active boot image slot<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> with <code>adb shell getprop ro.boot.slot_suffix</code>.</li>
<li>So to recap, <code>init_boot</code> takes priority over regular <code>boot</code> images, and if you have multiple <code>init_boot</code> or <code>boot</code> images with <code>_a</code>/<code>_b</code> suffixes, copy the active one:</li>
<li>Use the full filepath, including optional suffix, in <code>adb shell su -c dd if=&lt;the live boot image&gt; of=/wherever/you/want/to/dump/boot.img</code><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></li>
<li>Patch this image with the Magisk app and continue with <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html">Magisk&rsquo;s guide</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="re-lock-your-bootloader-1">Re-lock your bootloader!</h3>
<p>Go back into the bootloader interface (<code>adb -d reboot bootloader</code>) and <code>fastboot flashing lock</code> it. Then <code>fastboot reboot</code>, go to your developer options and disable OEM unlocking<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Then disable developer options. Then throw your phone into a lake.</p>

<p>Keeping root means giving apps access to root. However, we don&rsquo;t want every app to have root access, so we control who gets what. However, android will still attempt to notify apps if the user has root access. Banking apps are notorious for refusing to work if android snitches on you. So we have to play this constant game of trying to hide the fact that we have root from android, which seems impossible, but then you remember, we have complete root access. Anyway, we&rsquo;ve been winning this game for the past few years, but it was pretty dire like 5 years ago.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>AKA bootloader unlocking, NOT carrier unlocking. Carrier unlocking means you can use the phone on any carrier (but you will probably want to check band compatibility for a phone from a separate region).

<p>The &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of android rooting is probably from a bit after 2010 until about 2015. In that era, android lacked features that root access could implement. Phones often had removeable batteries and a bunch of unused hardware (aforementioned FM/AM radio, IR blasters, etc). Touchwiz was standard on a lot of phones and it was atrocious. Phones had worse hardware and were seriously bogged down by bloatware. Small communities  cropped up for each popular phone model. Gradually, the market settled, rooting became streamlined, and android phones became feature complete, companies stopped experimenting with hardware, and Samsung learned how to make a decent launcher.&#160;<a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

The Pixel 5 (redfin) has 2 submodels, <code>GD1YQ</code> and <code>GTT9Q</code>. This shows how models differ in radio firmware, exactly which carriers my phone could use via band compatibility, what region my phone actually belongs to etc., and if my rom was far from stock android, and I was flashing radio firmware&hellip;&#160;<a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Overwriting. The etymology is kindof fun. On most computers (and some phones), flash memory refers to a tiny standalone ssd, like a usb drive. Fast compared to hdds, and you write to it with bursts of relatively high voltage, hence &ldquo;flashing&rdquo;. Nowadays we use the same tech for ssds, nand flash memory.&#160;<a href="#fnref:15" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><br>- <code>data</code> stores our user data; installed apps, settings, etc. we won&rsquo;t flash this, but guides may have you wipe it.<br>- if wiping <code>cache</code> breaks something, it deserves to be broken. You may also encounter <code>dalvik cache</code> or <code>ART cache</code>. These can also generally be safely wiped. Dalvik is the old VM that apps used to run in. ART (android runtime) replaced it a long time ago, instead generating bytecode from apps to load them faster.<br>- <code>radio</code>: (or modem) some niche roms will want to flash it, particularly for carrier-locked phones.<br>- <code>misc</code> mostly stores settings related to other partitions.

<p>You aren&rsquo;t necessarily rooted right now. While you can overwrite existing partitions, some images don&rsquo;t provide root debugging. You can test by running <code>adb root</code>, or <code>adb shell</code> followed by <code>su</code>. If root debugging isn&rsquo;t an option in <code>developer options</code>, you could try TWRP (download the twrp img, and then boot into it with <code>fastboot boot &lt;img&gt;</code>). You can try your luck downloading stock firmware for your phone (check <a href="https://xda-developers.com">xda</a>), but obviously you can&rsquo;t get e.g. your data partition. Some phone OEMs provide tools for this exact reason, and you could always disassemble the phone to directly access the chips if you reeeeally wanted the images, I guess?&#160;<a href="#fnref:17" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>TWRP&rsquo;s UI has <code>sideload</code> in a submenu somewhere. You start sideloading on the phone, then you <code>adb sideload &lt;file.zip&gt;</code> from your pc.&#160;<a href="#fnref:18" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Android phones these days usually have an A/B booting system; there are actually 2 boot images, and only one is live, and the other receives updates, and then they switch. <code>adb shell getprop ro.boot.slot_suffix</code> is the idiomatic way to determine if A or B is live (we want the live one). If that doesn&rsquo;t work, enter your bootloader interface again and run <code>fastboot getvar current-slot</code> (sometimes it&rsquo;s also just displayed in the bootloader interface UI).&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:20">
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably want to dump the boot image in userspace (almost always <code>/storage/emulated/0/</code>) to delete it easily later.&#160;<a href="#fnref:20" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Also, change each <code>animation scale</code> to 0.5x, oh my god, it&rsquo;s so smooth.&#160;<a href="#fnref:21" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
