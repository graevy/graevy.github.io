        <h3 id="space-station-14">Space Station 14</h3>
<p>Is a <del>vehicle for improvised comedy</del> videogame fork of a 2001 atmospherics simulator. It&rsquo;s like a multiplayer Rimworld, with the complexity of Dwarf Fortress<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Twelve years ago I&rsquo;d play as an uncannily helpful mime, an alcoholic detective, or usually a micro-managing chief medical officer. Rounds last 1-3 hours, involve 10-100 players, 0-3 admins functioning as dungeon masters, and a subset of players designated as antagonists ranging from xenomorph queen to corporate spy.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>Ss14 follows its predecessor, ss13, which still exists in a feature-crept, if complete, legacy codebase, collapsing under the 2-decade weight of the hobbyist game developer revolving door. To play ss13, you have to download BYOND, a graveyard of a game client buoyed by ss13 players. While ss13 emerged alongside the popularity of entity-component design, its codebase is largely functional. It is so engine-bottlenecked that the functional player cap sits around 80<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Enter the fully open-source C# rewrite. It has ECS design, its own engine, order-of-magnitude performance increases, etc&hellip;I was disappointed I couldn&rsquo;t contribute to the codebase when I was learning python a few years ago. Things have changed!</p>
<h3 id="entity-component-system-conceptual-hurdles">Entity-Component-System Conceptual Hurdles</h3>
<p>Coming from rust, which splits your 2000s-era-language <code>class</code>es into inheritance <code>trait</code>s, data <code>struct</code>s, and method <code>impl</code>s, ECS was more approachable. Entities, components, and systems are almost 1:1. Zero experience<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> with async programming or event structures was my main hurdle. C# was completely new to me, but that&rsquo;s not the barrier it used to be with more language exposure<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and LLMs providing the basic syntax. I decided to stay with VSCode to learn fewer new things at the same time, despite Visual Studio&rsquo;s better C# support<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ideal learning experience because I&rsquo;m familiar enough with the game to know the requirements ahead of time. I remember the little display screens counting down the arrival of the emergency escape shuttle; coding them is purely conceptual. Most others on the project have a similar background, or actively play both versions of the game already. Very little needs to be communicated relative to other projects, which only has a few downsides: sparse documentation, style isn&rsquo;t rigidly enforced, lone devs prioritize features over fixes, etc.</p>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>I committed around an hour a day to ss14.</p>
<ul>
<li>6/25: I started seriously looking at the codebase.</li>
<li>6/27: I picked an <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues/16095">issue</a> and asked a maintainer about some of the code. I&rsquo;m usually ignored in the help channel and feel like an annoyance, so I stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Half-week break</p>
<ul>
<li>7/6: <code>git log</code>ing the entitysystem for item reflection tells me that there is an entity in the game that reflects hitscan projectiles.</li>
<li>7/8?: I understand enough to attach a component to an entity to influence the reflection system. There is a <a href="https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/super-simple-14/bike-horn">single page</a> of documentation about how to achieve this abstractly. I feel stupid, even though I manage to make an entity reflect a shot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another half-week here</p>
<ul>
<li>~7/15: total documentation exhaustion; keyword-searching discord channels becomes my main information source<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</li>
<li>7/17: The event system makes sense after I reread a single line from the page: &ldquo;Basically, we&rsquo;re telling the game: Whenever a UseInHandEvent is raised on an entity that has the PlaySoundOnUse component, I want you to call my OnUseInHand method.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my days was just learning to squash git commits. <code>git rebase -i HEAD~10</code> is laser-etched into my hippocampus.</p>
<ul>
<li>7/20?: I write the event handlers that govern reflection without crashing the debug environment for the first time. My solution for multiple separate entities providing the same reflection effect is beautiful.</li>
<li>7/21: <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/18186">PR Submitted</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am grossly overconfident.</p>
<ul>
<li>7/22?: The maintainer who wrote the issue likes my code and makes some value tweaks that introduce div0 errors I documented in the same PR. I immediately realize my solution won&rsquo;t work because someone is going to set <code>reflectprob</code> to 1 even if <code>// DON'T SET TO 1</code> is in the system and component files.</li>
<li>7/23: I decide to maintain a map of <code>entity</code>:<code>reflectprob</code>s. After I&rsquo;m done, I realize this is just a subset of equipment entities outside their designated slots; this is deeply unsafe. I simplify my solution by iterating over the full set after I comprehend the resource-intensity of pressing a single movement key while helping someone in the help channel. People seem annoyed I&rsquo;m wasting their time on a messy PR. My commit history is a mess and 3 maintainers are breathing down my neck about value tweaks like Office Space. I pick up my <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues/18249">second issue</a>.</li>
<li>~7/25: I understand the codebase enough to help people in the help channel. I commit to leaving nobody unanswered in the help channel<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</li>
<li>7/29: I understand the mess of 4 systems that interact<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> for my second issue and finish the proof-of-concept.</li>
<li>7/30: The issue maintainer merges my first PR. I&rsquo;m chuffed about it, but clearly generally insecure. A maintainer talks about how welcoming everyone is.</li>
</ul>
<p>My second (slightly more complex) issue &ldquo;solved&rdquo; after 1/4 of the time, my first PR merge<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and the end of July, impart a sense of milestone that compels me to blog about &ldquo;finally having learned C#, ECS, and the SS14 codebase&rdquo; or something similarly masturbatory.</p>

<p>The screen timer object inherits from <code>signaltimer</code>, the underlying system controlling machine linking (which I still don&rsquo;t understand). It needs to trigger when the emergency shuttle is called; there is no event for this, and its logic is located in <code>RoundEndSystem</code> and not <code>EmergencyShuttleSystem</code>. I create the unsupported events and leave a note in the <code>EmergencyShuttleSystem</code> methods that <code>RoundEndSystem</code> controls most of the logic; I&rsquo;m too green to get away with a refactor.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
