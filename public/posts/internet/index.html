        <p>This is a harm reduction guide for my friends who risk malware and surveillance, mostly while stealing things on the internet, but also just by browsing unhygenically.</p>
<p>Last updated: May 14 2023 (please <a href="mailto:avry@pm.me">email me</a> if anything needs attention)</p>
<h1 id="browser">Browser</h1>
<p>Chrome is phasing out privacy features and adblockers, and browser monopolies are bad, so please use a good browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox is <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">open source</a>, customizable, and the most popular alternative (that isn&rsquo;t Edge or Safari)</li>
<li>Vivaldi is a mostly open-source power-user browser, with tab management, integrated mail, calendar, translation, etc., but forks chromium</li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox addons I recommend<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to everyone in order of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ublock Origin</li>
<li>I still don&rsquo;t care about cookies</li>
<li>SponsorBlock (skips youtube sponsored segments)</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean">Bypass Paywalls Clean</a> (can&rsquo;t be installed regularly due to DMCA violation. download the xpi release and open it with firefox)</li>
<li>Alternative Player for Twitch.tv (hides ads)</li>
<li>Link Cleaner</li>
<li>Tab Session Manager (vivaldi does it better)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes addons will break a webpage. Most browsers have a safe mode for this, which loads a separate browser instance with zero customization.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t going to use a dedicated password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, firefox accounts have a sync feature between devices which also tracks public password database leaks. I recommend using the Secure Password Generator addon for whenever firefox&rsquo;s generator doesn&rsquo;t recognize a password field.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough RAM for your appalling browser tab habits, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230216193845/https://dev.to/msugakov/taking-firefox-memory-usage-under-control-on-linux-4b02">increasing <code>browser.low_commit_space_threshold_mb</code> makes firefox unload unused tabs</a> for better-than-chrome multitasking.</p>
<p>Mozilla maintains <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefox">a page</a> on switching from chrome to firefox.</p>
<h1 id="searching-tips">Searching tips</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of misinformation and advertising in search results because of Search Engine Optimization and a lack of financial incentive to fix the problem. Search engines have a syntax. It&rsquo;s helpful to know that, generally:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>seattle &quot;vegan&quot; restaurants</code> will only return results containing the keyword <code>vegan</code></li>
<li><code>seattle restaurants -pinterest -vegan</code> will only return results that don&rsquo;t contain <code>vegan</code> or <code>pinterest</code></li>
<li><code>seattle restaurants site:reddit.com</code> will only return results from reddit;</li>
<li><code>seattle &quot;vegan&quot; restaurants -pinterest site:reddit.com</code> will give you reddit posts containing the word vegan about seattle restaurants that don&rsquo;t have pinterest anywhere in their body or title.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find most people sitesearch reddit (appending <code>site:reddit.com</code>) to find product reviews that aren&rsquo;t sponsored.</p>
<p>For <em><strong>approximate</strong></em> knowledge that isn&rsquo;t monetized, instruction-tasked LLMs like chatGPT are a great way to search for things, because they&rsquo;re trained on the internet. I just searched &ldquo;what is the purpose of magnetic eye shadow pallette&rdquo;; I only saw ads. Here is a dialogue I just had with chatGPT:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/graevy/graevy.github.io/main/static/images/eyeshadow.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/">Archive.org</a> saves old webpages. This is very important work, and very useful. To find the link below, I searched <code>darknetmarkets 2022 site:reddit.com</code>, looked for the first banned subreddit I could find, put its URL into the internet archive, retrieved an old version of the site, and found a collection of helpful links in its sidebar.</p>
<h1 id="torvpns-and-the-darkweb">TOR/VPNs and the darkweb</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">The Onion Router</a> bounces your connection around dozens of different anonymous nodes before reaching an endpoint. This is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220821150904/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/majority-of-tor-crypto-keys-could-be-broken-by-nsa-researcher-says/">generally</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230122181201/https://gizmodo.com/fbi-tor-ip-address-muhammed-momtaz-al-azhari-isis-1849975153">secure</a> way to access the internet, but is slow. Make sure you <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/">properly configure</a> TOR. <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> is a portable linux distribution that pre-configures TOR, if you&rsquo;re both knowledgeable and paranoid.</p>
<p>VPNs are a node between user and destination. This means you connect to a website through a middleman, so that the website can&rsquo;t see your IP. The proxy can sell your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230224200913/https://www.statista.com/topics/1464/big-data/#topicOverview">valuable</a> data, which they as middlemen can neatly package. Any VPN service with an ad budget is selling that to remain competitive. Off the top of my head, PrivateInternetAccess &amp; NordVPN also explicitly cooperate with states. <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a> is a frequently recommended vpn service.</p>
<p>Darknet markets come and go all the time. At the moment, <a href="https://darknet.markets/">https://darknet.markets/</a> has a lot of links. You can only use these links in a TOR browser. Monero is the current anonymous cryptocurrency of choice; Bitcoin is more traceable.</p>
<h1 id="a-namepiracyapiracy"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Piracy</h1>
<p>Here is an overview of content-specific internet piracy ecosystems. I only give frank overviews here because you can find more in-depth resources at <a href="https://freemediaheckyeah.pages.dev/beginners-guide/">freemediaheckyeah</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/piracy/">the piracy subreddit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="explanation-of-torrenting">Explanation of torrenting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Other people have copies of files you want</li>
<li>You get <code>bits</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> of the files from whoever has them and is online</li>
<li>Many small downloads sum to a <code>torrent</code> of data</li>
<li>A <code>torrent client</code> connects you to <code>the swarm</code>: clients who are currently uploading/downloading those files</li>
<li>Swarm joining instructions are inside a <code>magnet link</code> or a <code>torrent file</code></li>
<li>These links and files are typically hosted on websites called <code>torrent trackers</code></li>
<li>Torrent trackers try to prevent users from uploading viruses</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="torrentings-legal-landscape">Torrenting&rsquo;s legal landscape</h3>
<ul>
<li>Torrenting is only illegal when copyrighted data is exchanged, therefore:
<ul>
<li>the torrent software is itself perfectly legal,</li>
<li>the torrent tracker is legal<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> because it doesn&rsquo;t host any copyrighted data; only references to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exchanging files reveals your <code>IP address</code> unless you use a <code>VPN</code> or <code>proxy</code>;</li>
<li>Copyright holders can join the swarm and notify your Internet Service Provider</li>
<li>Your <code>ISP</code> can nag you to stop torrenting, but they have a financial incentive to continue service and minimally legally comply
<ul>
<li>Never reply to these nags; you provide a paper trail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every now and then, a government will jail someone</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="torrentings-virus-landscape">Torrenting&rsquo;s virus landscape</h3>
<p>Here are the popular<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> reasons people make viruses for torrents. From most to least common:</p>
<ol>
<li>To get your credentials.
<ul>
<li>Common. Hidden malware that waits for you to login somewhere and records it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To leverage your hardware to provide value. Either your pc starts mining cryptocurrency, you inadvertently participate in a <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/botnet">botnet</a>, or both<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
<ul>
<li>Common because target diversity is great for botnets and people who torrent games usually have good mining GPUs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To install ransomware: holding your files hostage until a ransom is paid.
<ul>
<li>Rare because distributing ransomware quickly gets you banned from any decent tracker, individuals rarely pay out, and that level of system access is hard to obtain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, when torrenting anything with elevated permissions, we&rsquo;re really only worried about 1 and 2; the goal of someone poisoning torrents is to go undetected. You just have to wipe your system periodically, or when the GPU gets suspiciously warm. I know it&rsquo;s annoying.</p>
<p>Some miscellaneous tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Torrented media rarely contains viruses; torrented programs often contain viruses</li>
<li>New torrents are more likely to contain viruses than old torrents by virtue of content moderation
<ul>
<li>Trackers also usually have comments sections for each torrent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free antiviruses aren&rsquo;t really better than OS defaults e.g. Windows Defender</li>
<li>If you want to take a chance on a file, scan it with <a href="https://virustotal.com">virustotal</a></li>
<li>Wikipedia software articles usually have a link to their homepage to prevent you from getting phished:
<ul>
<li><code>facebook.co</code>, <code>facebook.net</code>, etc. are <em>not</em> the same websites as <code>facebook.com</code>, and can appear <em>identical</em>, down to the styling of the page or the URL you click: <a href="https://notfacebook.com">facebook.com</a></li>
<li><code>facebook.com.market</code> is a subdomain of <code>com.market</code>. Don&rsquo;t fall for this one; it&rsquo;s embarassing; I&rsquo;ll judge you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-torrent-client-should-i-use">What torrent client should I use?</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> is open source, cross platform, and beginner friendly</li>
<li><a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a> is open source and cross platform</li>
<li>Android: <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.proninyaroslav.libretorrent/">LibreTorrent</a> is open source</li>
<li>iOS: <a href="https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent/releases">iTorrent</a> is open source</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a different torrent tracker for whatever content you&rsquo;re downloading. The best general purpose tracker is <a href="https://1337x.to">1337x</a>, then whatever&rsquo;s on reddit&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/">piracy megathread</a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-pirate-_____">Where do I pirate _____?</h2>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>This is a lot less risky than it used to be because most cracks now use microsoft&rsquo;s windows images. To crack an active windows installation, go to <a href="https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts">this github</a><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and follow the instructions (you want to use HWID). Remember to open powershell/terminal <em>as an administrator</em>.</p>
<p>To install windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get latest windows image from microsoft (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO">10</a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11/">11</a>)</li>
<li>Take a thumb drive and either <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">rufus</a> (windows), Disk Utility (mac), or something like <code>dd if=/path/to/iso of=/path/to/usb conv=fsync bs=8M</code> (linux) to make an installation USB</li>
<li>Reboot with the USB plugged in. You will usually have to <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Enter-BIOS">enter your BIOS</a> (or boot menu), typically by holding down the f2 (or f8, f12, insert, delete&hellip;) key, booting from the USB or changing your boot order to prioritize it.</li>
<li>Install Windows. Select Pro or Pro N (Pro N is the EU-compliant version with less bloat, but you&rsquo;ll want to install the Windows Media Feature Pack yourself)</li>
<li>I recommend <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tronscript">tronscript</a> for debloating<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and <a href="https://chocolatey.org">chocolatey</a> for package managing<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></li>
<li>An example tron command for a <code>tron.bat</code> file downloaded to <code>C:\Users\a\Downloads\Tron</code> on a fresh machine is <code>C:\Users\a\Downloads\Tron\tron.bat -a -sa -sd -scc -v</code> (skipping antivirus scans, defrag, and cookies). Run this in cmd as an administrator.</li>
<li>Crack windows using the <em>admin</em> powershell github commands in the <a href="https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts">link</a> above</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get a virus from downloading music, not that anyone does that anymore. <a href="https://rutracker.org">rutracker</a> is my favorite public tracker for music<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>; you need to make an account and the whole website is russian so a translation browser extension is a good idea. <a href="https://www.slsknet.org/">Soulseek</a> has a good english-language selection but it&rsquo;s kindof closed off from the rest of the torrent ecosystem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably looking for a cracked spotify app in Apps below. <a href="https://revanced.io/">revanced</a>/<a href="https://newpipe.net/">newpipe</a> will handle youtube. These projects come and go.</p>
<p>For desktops, <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases">yt-dlp</a> downloads youtube media, and just using the web version of spotify with ublock origin on firefox should block its ads.</p>
<h3 id="video">Video</h3>
<p>Low risk<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> for the same reason as above; video files don&rsquo;t need elevated permissions. Get these by going to your public tracker of choice (I recommend <a href="https://1337x.to">1337x</a> first, then <a href="https://thepiratebay.org">thepiratebay</a>)<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Private trackers have the best selections; those typically involve being invited and passing a screening process.</p>
<p>When starting a new torrent, downloading in &ldquo;sequential order&rdquo; or similar lets you functionally stream video<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. You only need to download about 5-10% of a video before you can play it if your connection is fast enough. Use <a href="https://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> or <a href="https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc/releases">MPC-HC</a> to watch videos.</p>
<p>I asked chatGPT: &ldquo;provide a glossary of terms (such as &ldquo;x265&rdquo;, or &ldquo;5.1&rdquo;, or &ldquo;BRRip&rdquo;) used to describe video hosted on torrent trackers&rdquo; and received this response before it was cut off due to length:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Sure, here&#39;s a glossary of terms commonly used to describe video hosted on torrent trackers:

x265: An advanced video compression format that provides better video quality than the older x264 format, while using less storage space and bandwidth.

5.1: Refers to a type of audio configuration that includes five channels of audio (left, center, right, left surround, and right surround) plus a separate subwoofer channel for bass frequencies. This configuration is commonly used in home theater systems.

BRRip: A video format that stands for &#34;Blu-ray rip.&#34; It refers to a high-quality video that has been ripped directly from a Blu-ray disc.

CAM: Short for &#34;camera.&#34; A CAM copy is a low-quality recording of a movie that was captured in a movie theater using a handheld camera. The audio and video quality are typically poor.

DVDRip: A video format that stands for &#34;DVD rip.&#34; It refers to a high-quality video that has been ripped directly from a DVD.

HDRip: A video format that stands for &#34;High Dynamic Range rip.&#34; It refers to a video that has been encoded with HDR, which provides a wider range of colors and better contrast than standard video.

WEB-DL: A video format that stands for &#34;web download.&#34; It refers to a video that has been downloaded from an online streaming service, such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.

HDTV: Stands for &#34;high-definition television.&#34; It refers to a television format that provides a higher resolution and better image quality than standard definition television.

Remux: A video format that refers to a high-quality video that has been copied from a Blu-ray or DVD disc without any compression or loss of quality.

SD: Stands for &#34;standard definition.&#34;
</code></pre><h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
<p>Android users: get illicit APKs from <a href="https://forum.mobilism.org/index.php">mobilism</a><sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. This ecosystem&rsquo;s pretty seedy. <a href="https://f-droid.org/">f-droid</a> is a package manager like the google play store, except it only has free open source apps. F-droid&rsquo;s app is notoriously buggy so try some frontends like Neo Store or Droid-ify.</p>
<p>Apple users: jailbreaking is outside the scope of this guide. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/">sideloaded</a> is a community for loading custom apps that don&rsquo;t require jailbreaking.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>This is the riskiest. I&rsquo;ll direct you to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/software_downloads">piracy megathread</a>, which vouches for <a href="https://w14.monkrus.ws/">m0nkrus</a>&rsquo; repacks. Otherwise, find torrents on a public tracker and roll the dice. Use a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">virtual machine</a><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> for one-shot tasks; that&rsquo;s also beyond the scope of this guide.</p>
<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>There is a bounty ecosystem where people donate to reputable game crackers<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Don&rsquo;t get games off of public trackers like thepiratebay if you can avoid it. Two of the most reputable crackers are <a href="https://fitgirl-repacks.site">fitgirl</a><sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> and <a href="https://dodi-repacks.site">dodi</a><sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. If they don&rsquo;t have what you&rsquo;re looking for, go search <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch">the CrackWatch subreddit</a> to find a reputable cracker who does.</p>
<h3 id="booksacademic-papers">Books/academic papers</h3>
<p><a href="https://gen.lib.rus.ec">libgen</a> is the best<sup id="fnref3:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. <a href="https://www.myanonamouse.net/">Myanonamouse</a> is a good private tracker for books that will let you in after a technical interview. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/reading_material_and_elearning">piracy megathread</a> maintains a list of book trackers; these are always coming and going. A filetype search<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> with pdf, mobi, epub, etc. extensions is a last resort.</p>
<p>For papers specifically, check libgen, then <a href="https://sci-hub.se/">sci-hub</a> (mediocre uptime; blame the lawsuits), then <a href="https://academictorrents.com/">academictorrents</a>, then the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/reading_material_and_elearning">piracy megathread</a>, then&hellip;just email paper authors and they&rsquo;ll usually send you a copy. You might be able to find a non-paywalled copy on google scholar. Extensions like Bypass Paywalls Clean or Unpaywall have historically been bad at papers.</p>

<p>People usually recommend installing privacy addons e.g. Privacy Badger, Privacy Possum, Don&rsquo;t Track Me Google&hellip; I have three reasons not to tell new firefox users to install them:</p>
<ul>
<li>they can break websites</li>
<li>they can increase vulnerability to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/block-fingerprinting/">fingerprinting</a></li>
<li>firefox rapidly adopts popular privacy addon features when they don&rsquo;t conflict with mozilla&rsquo;s financial interests</li>

<p>Some jurisdictions obligate the torrent tracker to remove illegal content references. This is a flimsy legal argument with a major corporate backing; creative ccTLDs (.to, .cr, .vu&hellip;) make this difficult to enforce. In the absence of jurisdiction, vested interests will DDoS trackers to weaken their reliability.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>It should be noted that historically this was a pretty symbiotic relationship. You save money, someone gets a botnet member (you usually never noticed), everyone wins. If you caught too many botnets, you&rsquo;d reinstall your OS, and your PC would be fast again. Crypto mining and online payments have completely upended this dynamic. Now, viruses want your credentials/silicon with a vengeance.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Bloatware refers to unwanted bundled software (PUPs); debloating is the process of removing bloatware, often complicated by e.g. the financial incentive of microsoft to place ads in the start menu.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>A package manager downloads, installs, uninstalls, and updates software for you. Entering e.g. <code>choco install firefox audacity vlc qbittorrent</code> in <em>admin</em> powershell installs these apps; <code>choco uninstall audacity</code> will uninstall audacity only if chocolatey installed it; <code>choco upgrade all</code> updates every chocolatey-managed app on your machine at once. Anyone allergic to powershell can use Chocolatey GUI, which is pretty mediocre. Package managers only manage apps they installed, so they&rsquo;re best configured right after a full wipe. This is how linux handles software, grafted onto windows.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>By default, swarms serve seemingly random chunks of files. Sequential downloading orders those chunks first -&gt; last.
