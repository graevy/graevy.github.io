        <p>This is a harm reduction guide for my friends who risk malware and surveillance, mostly while stealing things on the internet, but also just by browsing unhygenically.</p>
<p>Last updated: Apr 2 2023</p>
<h1 id="browser">Browser</h1>
<p>Chrome is phasing out privacy features and adblockers, and browser monopolies are bad, so stop using it!</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox is open source, customizable, and the most popular alternative (that isn&rsquo;t Edge or Safari)</li>
<li>Vivaldi is a mostly open-source power-user browser, with tab management, integrated mail, calendar, translation, etc., but forks chromium</li>
</ul>
<p>Firefox addons I recommend to everyone in order of importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ublock Origin</li>
<li>I still don&rsquo;t care about cookies</li>
<li>SponsorBlock (skips youtube sponsored segments)</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean">Bypass Paywalls Clean</a> (can&rsquo;t be installed regularly due to DMCA violation. download the xpi release and open it with firefox)</li>
<li>Alternative Player for Twitch.tv (hides ads)</li>
<li>Link Cleaner</li>
<li>Tab Session Manager (vivaldi does it better)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes addons will break a webpage. Most browsers have a safe mode for this, which loads a separate browser instance with zero customization.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t going to use a dedicated password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, firefox accounts have a sync feature between devices which also tracks public password database leaks. I recommend using the Secure Password Generator addon for this.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have enough RAM for your appalling browser tab habits, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230216193845/https://dev.to/msugakov/taking-firefox-memory-usage-under-control-on-linux-4b02">increasing <code>browser.low_commit_space_threshold_mb</code> makes firefox unload tabs</a>.</p>
<p>Mozilla maintains <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefox">a page</a> on switching from chrome to firefox.</p>
<h1 id="searching-tips">Searching tips</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of misinformation and advertising in search results because of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and a lack of financial incentive to fix the problem. Search engines have a general syntax you can use to search better. It&rsquo;s helpful to know that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>seattle &quot;vegan&quot; restaurants</code> will only return results containing the keyword <code>vegan</code></li>
<li><code>seattle restaurants -pinterest -vegan</code> will only return results that don&rsquo;t contain <code>vegan</code> or <code>pinterest</code></li>
<li><code>seattle restaurants site:reddit.com</code> will only return results from reddit;</li>
<li><code>seattle &quot;vegan&quot; restaurants -pinterest site:reddit.com</code> will give you reddit posts containing the word vegan about seattle restaurants that don&rsquo;t have pinterest anywhere in their body or title.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find most people sitesearch reddit (appending <code>site:reddit.com</code>) to find product reviews that aren&rsquo;t sponsored.</p>
<p>For approximate knowledge that isn&rsquo;t monetized, AI chatbots like chatGPT are a great way to search for things, because they&rsquo;re trained on the internet. I just searched &ldquo;what is the purpose of magnetic eye shadow pallette&rdquo;; I only saw ads. Here is a dialogue I just had with chatGPT:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/graevy/graevy.github.io/main/static/images/eyeshadow.png" alt=""></p>
<p>AI chatbots are bad at giving you exactly correct answers. I just asked chatGPT what 2+3-5+12*4/2 is (24); it said 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/">Archive.org</a> saves old webpages. This is very important work, and very useful. To find the darknet link below, I searched <code>darknetmarkets 2022 site:reddit.com</code>, looked for the first banned subreddit I could find, put its URL into the internet archive, retrieved an old version of the site, and found a collection of helpful links in its sidebar.</p>
<h1 id="torvpns-and-the-darkweb">TOR/VPNs and the darkweb</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">The Onion Router</a> bounces your connection around dozens of different anonymous nodes before reaching an endpoint. This is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220821150904/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/majority-of-tor-crypto-keys-could-be-broken-by-nsa-researcher-says/">generally</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230122181201/https://gizmodo.com/fbi-tor-ip-address-muhammed-momtaz-al-azhari-isis-1849975153">secure</a> way to access the internet, but is slow. Make sure you <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/">properly configure</a> TOR. <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> is a portable linux distribution that pre-configures TOR, if you&rsquo;re both knowledgeable and paranoid.</p>
<p>VPNs are a node between user and endpoint. This means you connect to a website through a middleman, so that the website can&rsquo;t see your IP. The proxy can sell your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230224200913/https://www.statista.com/topics/1464/big-data/#topicOverview">valuable</a> data, which they as middlemen can neatly package, and any VPN service with an ad budget is almost certainly doing that to remain competitive. Off the top of my head, PrivateInternetAccess &amp; NordVPN also explicitly cooperate with states. <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/">Mullvad</a> is a frequently recommended vpn service.</p>
<p>Darknet markets come and go all the time. At the moment, <a href="https://darknet.markets/">https://darknet.markets/</a> has a lot of links. You can only use these links in a TOR browser. Monero is the current anonymous cryptocurrency of choice; Bitcoin is more traceable.</p>
<h1 id="piracy">Piracy</h1>
<p>Here is an overview of content-specific internet piracy ecosystems. I only give frank overviews here because you can find more in-depth resources available at sites like <a href="https://freemediaheckyeah.pages.dev/beginners-guide/">freemediaheckyeah</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/piracy/">the piracy subreddit</a></p>
<h3 id="explanation-of-torrenting">Explanation of torrenting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Other people have copies of files you want</li>
<li>You get pieces of the files from whoever has them and is online</li>
<li>Many small downloads add up to a <em>torrent</em> of data</li>
<li>A <em>torrent client</em> connects people who are uploading and downloading</li>
<li>Everyone currently exchanging files is part of <em>the swarm</em></li>
<li>Joining a swarm requires a <em>magnet link</em> or a <em>torrent file</em></li>
<li>These links and files are hosted on a website called a <em>torrent tracker</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What torrent client should I use?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a> is open source and cross platform</li>
<li><a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> is popular for its low resource consumption</li>
<li>Android: <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.proninyaroslav.libretorrent/">LibreTorrent</a> is open source</li>
<li>iOS: <a href="https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent/releases">iTorrent</a> is open source</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a different torrent tracker for whatever content you&rsquo;re downloading. The best general purpose tracker is <a href="https://1337x.to">1337x</a>, then whatever&rsquo;s on reddit&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/">piracy megathread</a>.</p>
<h3 id="virus-safety">Virus safety</h3>
<ul>
<li>The torrent tracker tries to prevent people from uploading <em>viruses</em></li>
<li>Copyright holders will sometimes join the swarm to track your <em>IP address</em> and nag your internet provider
<ul>
<li>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxies can hide your IP address behind another</li>
<li>Maybe try a less popular torrent for the latest TV show episode release instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you want to take a chance on a file, scan it with <a href="https://virustotal.com">virustotal</a></li>
<li>Know your file extensions: a .exe is a windows program, not a music file</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t get phished:
<ul>
<li>Try to get a URL secondhand through wikipedia or something before searching</li>
<li><code>facebook.com.market</code> is a subdomain of <code>com.market</code></li>
<li><code>facebook.co</code>, <code>facebook.net</code>, etc. are <em>not</em> the same websites as <code>facebook.com</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You usually won&rsquo;t know if you have a virus; you should wipe your drive and reinstall your OS every once in awhile</li>
<li>Free antiviruses aren&rsquo;t better than whatever is bundled with your OS now</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-i-pirate-_____">Where do I pirate _____?</h2>
<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>This is a lot less risky than it used to be because most cracks now use microsoft&rsquo;s windows images. To crack an active windows installation, go to <a href="https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts">this github</a> and follow the instructions (you want to use HWID). Remember to open powershell/terminal <em>as an administrator</em>.</p>
<p>To install windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get latest windows image from microsoft (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO">10</a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11/">11</a>)</li>
<li>Create an installation USB with <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">rufus</a> (windows), Disk Utility (mac), or something like <code>dd if=/path/to/iso of=/path/to/usb conv=fsync bs=8M</code> (linux)</li>
<li>Reboot with the USB plugged in. You will usually have to <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Enter-BIOS">enter your BIOS</a> (or boot menu), typically by holding down the f2 (or f8, f12, insert, delete&hellip;) key, booting from the USB or changing your boot order to prioritize it.</li>
<li>Go through the installation process, select Pro or Pro N (Pro N is the EU-compliant version with less bloat, but you&rsquo;ll want to install the Windows Media Feature Pack yourself)</li>
<li>I recommend <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tronscript">tronscript</a> for debloating and <a href="https://chocolatey.org">chocolatey</a> for package managing</li>
<li>An example tron command for a <code>tron.bat</code> file downloaded to <code>C:\Users\a\Downloads\Tron</code> on a fresh machine is <code>C:\Users\a\Downloads\Tron\tron.bat -a -sa -sd -scc -v</code> (skipping antivirus scans, defrag, and cookies). Run this in cmd as an administrator.</li>
<li>Crack windows using the <em>admin</em> powershell github commands in the <a href="https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts">link</a> above</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get a virus from downloading music, not that anyone does that anymore. <a href="https://rutracker.org">rutracker</a> is my favorite public tracker for music (rip what.cd); you need to make an account and the whole website is russian so a translation browser extension is a good idea. <a href="https://www.slsknet.org/">Soulseek</a> has a pretty good english-language selection but it&rsquo;s kindof closed off from the rest of the torrent ecosystem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably looking for a cracked spotify app in Apps below. <a href="https://revanced.io/">revanced</a>/<a href="https://newpipe.net/">newpipe</a> will handle youtube. These projects come and go.</p>
<p>For desktops, <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases">yt-dlp</a> downloads youtube media, and just using the web version of spotify with ublock origin on firefox should block its ads.</p>
<h3 id="video">Video</h3>
<p>Low risk for the same reason as above; video files don&rsquo;t need elevated permissions. Get these by going to your public tracker of choice (I recommend <a href="https://1337x.to">1337x</a> first, then <a href="https://thepiratebay.org">thepiratebay</a>)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Private trackers have the best selections; those typically involve being invited and passing a screening process.</p>
<p>Check the &ldquo;Download in sequential order&rdquo; button in qbittorrent so you can watch videos before you&rsquo;ve finished downloading them. You only need to download about 5-10% of a video before you can play it if your connection is fast enough. Use <a href="https://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> to watch videos. <a href="https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc/releases">MPC-HC</a> is the only competitor I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>I asked chatGPT: &ldquo;provide a glossary of terms (such as &ldquo;x265&rdquo;, or &ldquo;5.1&rdquo;, or &ldquo;BRRip&rdquo;) used to describe video hosted on torrent trackers&rdquo; and received this response before it was cut off due to length:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Sure, here&#39;s a glossary of terms commonly used to describe video hosted on torrent trackers:

x265: An advanced video compression format that provides better video quality than the older x264 format, while using less storage space and bandwidth.

5.1: Refers to a type of audio configuration that includes five channels of audio (left, center, right, left surround, and right surround) plus a separate subwoofer channel for bass frequencies. This configuration is commonly used in home theater systems.

BRRip: A video format that stands for &#34;Blu-ray rip.&#34; It refers to a high-quality video that has been ripped directly from a Blu-ray disc.

CAM: Short for &#34;camera.&#34; A CAM copy is a low-quality recording of a movie that was captured in a movie theater using a handheld camera. The audio and video quality are typically poor.

DVDRip: A video format that stands for &#34;DVD rip.&#34; It refers to a high-quality video that has been ripped directly from a DVD.

HDRip: A video format that stands for &#34;High Dynamic Range rip.&#34; It refers to a video that has been encoded with HDR, which provides a wider range of colors and better contrast than standard video.

WEB-DL: A video format that stands for &#34;web download.&#34; It refers to a video that has been downloaded from an online streaming service, such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.

HDTV: Stands for &#34;high-definition television.&#34; It refers to a television format that provides a higher resolution and better image quality than standard definition television.

Remux: A video format that refers to a high-quality video that has been copied from a Blu-ray or DVD disc without any compression or loss of quality.

SD: Stands for &#34;standard definition.&#34;
</code></pre><h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
<p>Android users: get illicit APKs from <a href="https://forum.mobilism.org/index.php">mobilism</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This ecosystem&rsquo;s pretty seedy. <a href="https://f-droid.org/">f-droid</a> is a package manager like the google play store, except it only has free open source apps. F-droid&rsquo;s app is notoriously buggy so try some frontends like Neo Store or Droid-ify.</p>
<p>Apple users: jailbreaking is outside the scope of this guide. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/">sideloaded</a> is a community for loading custom apps that don&rsquo;t require jailbreaking. I can&rsquo;t personally vouch for them, though.</p>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>This is the riskiest. I&rsquo;ll direct you to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/software_downloads">piracy megathread</a>, which vouches for <a href="https://w14.monkrus.ws/">m0nkrus</a>&rsquo; repacks. Otherwise, find torrents on a public tracker and roll the dice. Use a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">virtual machine</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> if you can; that&rsquo;s also beyond the scope of this guide.</p>
<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>There is a bounty ecosystem where people donate to reputable game crackers. Don&rsquo;t get games off of public trackers like thepiratebay if you can avoid it. Two of the most reputable crackers are <a href="https://fitgirl-repacks.site">fitgirl</a><sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and <a href="https://dodi-repacks.site">dodi</a><sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. If they don&rsquo;t have what you&rsquo;re looking for, go search <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch">the CrackWatch subreddit</a> to find a reputable cracker who does.</p>
<h3 id="booksacademic-papers">Books/academic papers</h3>
<p><a href="https://gen.lib.rus.ec">libgen</a> is the best<sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. <a href="https://www.myanonamouse.net/">Myanonamouse</a> is a good private tracker for books that will let you in after a technical interview. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/reading_material_and_elearning">piracy megathread</a> maintains a list of book trackers; these are always coming and going. A filetype search<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> with pdf, mobi, epub, etc. extensions is a last resort.</p>
<p>For papers specifically, check libgen, then <a href="https://sci-hub.se/">sci-hub</a> (mediocre uptime; blame the lawsuits), then <a href="https://academictorrents.com/">academictorrents</a>, then the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/reading_material_and_elearning">piracy megathread</a>, then&hellip;just email paper authors and they&rsquo;ll usually send you a copy. You might be able to find a non-paywalled copy on google scholar. Extensions like Bypass Paywalls Clean or Unpaywall have historically been bad at papers.</p>
