#### Problem

The Missouri Attorney General's office maintained a page ([html backup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graevy/graevy.github.io/main/resources/missouri.html)) for reporting "Transgender concerns" after the state passed legislation banning gender-affirming care.

#### Solution

An overzealous [noise generator](https://github.com/boiled-water-tsar/eat-my-entire-trans-ass-andrew-bailey) which probably got an IP filtered very quickly. Still, the form was taken down, so I'll call that a victory.

#### Contribution

[Localize the junk address data to Missouri](https://github.com/boiled-water-tsar/eat-my-entire-trans-ass-andrew-bailey/pull/1/commits/4569303e8f41755537b8eceeb85bcf5a6cf74c1d) by:
- finding a sufficiently large dataset of gps-valid missouri addresses and
- writing an original algorithm utilizing my 1337 programming skills:

- also a [quick](https://github.com/boiled-water-tsar/eat-my-entire-trans-ass-andrew-bailey/pull/5/commits/0428d23f7bc6ea611af54c1415b7d02b92519563) and [dirty](https://github.com/boiled-water-tsar/eat-my-entire-trans-ass-andrew-bailey/pull/19) script for feasible missouri phone #s

#### Commentary

I was the first contributor! It kinda took off. The [captcha bypass](https://github.com/boiled-water-tsar/eat-my-entire-trans-ass-andrew-bailey/issues/12) was pretty funny after they implemented it.

It's weird to see a project complete its goal almost immediately. Hesitant to attribute the success to this script. I have a half-written test suite and a second branch to-be-tested for the other form to "report undocumented workers" but there is a very intimidating warning telling me not to submit junk data on that page, so I might just publish what I have eventually and then let some activist botnet deal with it.

I grabbed the 3-billion parameter bloomz model from huggingface to locally host LLM text generation to waste more resources, but we won before I even finished configuring it. I almost wish this lasted longer?
