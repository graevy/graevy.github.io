### Space Station 14

Is a ~~vehicle for improvised comedy~~ videogame fork of a 2001 atmospherics simulator. It's like a multiplayer Rimworld, with the complexity of Dwarf Fortress[^1]. Twelve years ago I'd play as an uncannily helpful mime, an alcoholic detective, or usually a micro-managing chief medical officer. Rounds last 1-3 hours, involve 10-100 players, 0-3 admins functioning as dungeon masters, and a subset of players designated as antagonists ranging from xenomorph queen to corporate spy.

### The Problem

Ss14 follows its predecessor, ss13, which still exists in a feature-crept, if complete, legacy codebase, collapsing under the 2-decade weight of the hobbyist game developer revolving door. To play ss13, you have to download BYOND, a graveyard of a game client now only funded by ss13 players. While ss13 emerged alongside the popularity of entity-component design, its codebase is largely functional. It is so engine-bottlenecked that the functional player cap sits around 80[^7].

Enter the fully open-source C# rewrite. It has ECS design, its own engine, order-of-magnitude performance increases, etc...I was very disappointed I couldn't contribute to the codebase when I was learning python a few years ago. Things have changed!

### Entity-Component-System Conceptual Hurdles

Coming from rust, which splits your 2000s-era-language `class`es into inheritance `trait`s, data `struct`s, and method `impl`s, ECS was more approachable. Entities, components, and systems are almost 1:1. Zero experience[^2] with async programming or an event structures was my main hurdle. C# was completely new to me, but that's not the barrier it used to be with more language exposure[^3] and LLMs providing the basic syntax. I decided to stay with VSCode to learn fewer new things at the same time, despite Visual Studio's better C# support[^4].

It's an ideal learning experience because I'm familiar enough with the game to know the requirements ahead of time. I remember the little display screens counting down the arrival of the emergency escape shuttle; coding them is purely conceptual. Most others on the project have a similar background, or actively play both versions of the game already. Very little needs to be communicated relative to other projects, which only has a few downsides: sparse documentation, style isn't rigidly enforced, lone devs prioritize features over fixes, etc.

### Timeline

I committed around an hour a day to ss14.

- 6/25: I started seriously looking at the codebase.
- 6/27: I picked an [issue](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues/16095) and asked a maintainer about some of the code. I'm usually ignored in the help channel and feel like an annoyance, so I stop reaching out.

I broke for half a week here

- 7/6: `git log`ing the entitysystem for item reflection tells me that there is an entity in the game that reflects hitscan projectiles.
- 7/8?: I understand enough to attach a component to an entity to influence the reflection system. There is a [single page](https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/super-simple-14/bike-horn) of documentation about how to achieve this abstractly. I feel stupid, even though I manage to make an entity reflect a shot.

Another half-week here

- ~7/15: total documentation exhaustion; keyword-searching discord channels becomes my main information source[^5].
- 7/17: The event system makes sense after I reread a single line from the page: "Basically, we're telling the game: Whenever a UseInHandEvent is raised on an entity that has the PlaySoundOnUse component, I want you to call my OnUseInHand method."

One of my days at this point was entirely learning to squash git commits. `git rebase -i HEAD~10` is laser-etched into my hippocampus.

- 7/20?: I write the event handlers that govern reflection without crashing the debug environment for the first time. My solution for multiple separate entities providing the same reflection effect is beautiful.
- 7/21: [PR Submitted](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/18186).

I am grossly overconfident.

- 7/22?: The maintainer who wrote the issue likes my code and makes some value tweaks that introduce div0 errors I documented in the same PR. I immediately realize my solution won't work because someone is going to set `reflectprob` to 1 even if `// DON'T SET TO 1` is in the system and component files.
- 7/23: I decide to maintain a map of `entity`:`reflectprob`s. After I'm done, I realize this is just a subset of equipment entities outside their designated equipment slots; this is deeply unsafe. I simplify my solution by iterating over the full set after I comprehend the resource-intensity of pressing a single movement key while helping someone in the help channel. People seem annoyed I'm wasting their time on a messy PR. My commit history is a mess and 3 maintainers are breathing down my neck about value tweaks like Office Space. I pick up my [second issue](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues/18249).
- ~7/25: I understand the codebase enough to help people in the help channel. I commit to leaving nobody unanswered in the help channel[^9].
- 7/29: I understand the mess of 4 systems that interact[^6] for my second issue and finish the proof-of-concept.
- 7/30: The issue maintainer merges my first PR. I'm chuffed about it, but clearly generally insecure. A maintainer talks about how welcoming everyone is; I'm going to have to adapt to this for future projects.

My second (slightly more complex) issue solved after 1/4 of the time, my first PR merge[^8], and the end of July, impart a sense of milestone that compels me to blog about "finally having learned C#, ECS, and the SS14 codebase" or something similarly masturbatory.

[^1]: both games I have never played

[^2]: one python telegram bot aside,

[^3]: major semantic overlap with java

[^4]: I think this was correct, but IDEs aren't that significant

[^5]: Discord is losing a lot of revenue if they aren't labbing fine-tuned LLM subscriptions for project servers' documentations. The search is mediocre and there's a lot of chaffe; the exact conditions pushing search engines to adopt their own LLMs.

[^6]: The screen timer object inherits from `signaltimer`, the underlying system controlling machine linking (which I still don't understand). It needs to trigger when the emergency shuttle is called; there is no event for this, and its logic is located in `RoundEndSystem` and not `EmergencyShuttleSystem`. I create the unsupported events and leave a note in the `EmergencyShuttleSystem` methods that `RoundEndSystem` controls most of the logic; I'm too green to get away with a refactor.

[^7]: ss14 supports around 3x that number at a larger tickrate

[^8]: don't even try to pretend the contributor tag isn't a status symbol

[^9]: actually one of the best ways to learn things. if you already know it, it's a 30 second explanation. if explaining it doesn't take 30 seconds, you probably don't know it.
